\title{A utility function to calculate the consumption rate of each species on all prey assuming a type I functional response.}
\usage{
Cijfcn(usin, h = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{usin}{The community on which feeding rate calculations are made.}

\item{h}{The value of the handling time if you want to use a type II functional response. If NA, you are using a Type I functional response.}
}
\value{
A matrix of consumption rates with units set by the the biomass input units in biomass and time.
}
